# ðŸš€ AI Companion System Implementation Plan

> **Source of Truth:** This plan is derived from `deployment-plan.md` which contains the complete technical specifications, architecture details, and implementation requirements.

## Overview
This is a comprehensive multi-user AI companion system with advanced personality modeling, memory management, and proactive conversation capabilities. The system includes 7 containerized services, sophisticated personality evolution, episodic/semantic memory, security features, and full Discord integration.

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation (Day 1)
**Core Infrastructure Setup**
1. **Project Structure**: Create the complete directory structure with 40+ files
2. **Database Layer**: Implement 5 PostgreSQL migration files with user-scoped schemas
3. **Docker Environment**: Set up docker-compose.yml with 7 services (PostgreSQL+pgvector, Qdrant, Redis, Letta, Embedding Service, Gateway, Discord Bot, Caddy)
4. **Configuration**: Environment management with validation and multi-environment profiles
5. **Basic Health Checks**: Ensure all services can start and communicate

## Phase 2: Core Services (Day 1-2)
**Essential Service Implementation**
1. **Database Manager**: Connection pooling, user-scoped queries, transaction management
2. **Gemini Embedding Service**: FastAPI wrapper with Redis caching for 1536-dimensional embeddings
3. **Groq Client**: Fast LLM client for importance scoring and security detection
4. **Chutes Client**: Primary LLM client with automatic fallback logic
5. **Service Dependencies**: Proper initialization order to prevent circular dependencies

## Phase 3: Personality & Memory Systems (Day 2-3)
**Advanced AI Features**
1. **Personality Engine**: Big Five traits (fixed) + PAD emotional state (dynamic) + quirk/need evolution
2. **Memory Manager**: Episodic/semantic memory with Qdrant vector storage and MMR retrieval
3. **Importance Scorer**: LLM-based memory scoring with caching and fallback heuristics
4. **OCC Appraisal Engine**: Emotion calculation based on interaction context
5. **Data Models**: 15+ Pydantic models for personality, memory, and interactions

## Phase 4: Letta Integration & Security (Day 3)
**Agent Management & Protection**
1. **Letta Service**: Agent lifecycle, personality injection, conversation processing
2. **Security Suite**: Semantic injection detection and defensive response generation
3. **User Service**: Profile management and lifecycle states
4. **API Routers**: 4 complete FastAPI routers (chat, memory, personality, admin)

## Phase 5: Discord Integration (Day 3-4)
**User Interface Layer**
1. **Discord Bot**: Message handling, user locks, proactive messaging capability
2. **Slash Commands**: /companion, /memories, /personality commands with full functionality
3. **Discord Utils**: Rate-limited proactive messaging with DM/channel fallback
4. **Gateway Registration**: Bot-to-API communication for proactive features

## Phase 6: Advanced Features (Day 4-5)
**Proactive & Background Systems**
1. **Proactive Manager**: Conversation initiation based on timing, personality, and needs
2. **Reflection System**: Nightly personality evolution and memory consolidation
3. **Background Tasks**: APScheduler integration with 5 recurring jobs
4. **MMR Algorithm**: Diverse memory retrieval implementation

## Phase 7: Production Readiness (Day 5-6)
**Reliability & Monitoring**
1. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception hierarchy with degraded mode operation
2. **Health Monitoring**: Service status endpoints and automated recovery
3. **Testing Suite**: Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end conversation testing
4. **Performance Optimization**: Connection pooling, caching strategies, batch operations

## Phase 8: Deployment & Documentation (Day 6-7)
**Final Deployment**
1. **Environment Setup**: Production configuration and secrets management
2. **Deployment Scripts**: Backup, monitoring, and maintenance scripts
3. **API Documentation**: Complete OpenAPI documentation for all endpoints
4. **User Guides**: Discord command usage and admin interface documentation

## Key Technical Challenges
- **Service Orchestration**: 4-phase initialization preventing circular dependencies
- **Multi-User Scoping**: All operations isolated by user_id
- **Error Resilience**: Fallback strategies for each service failure scenario
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized vector search with importance scoring
- **Real-time Processing**: Sub-second response times with complex personality calculations

## Success Metrics
- All 7 services running smoothly in Docker
- Multi-user conversations with personality evolution
- Proactive conversation initiation working
- Security system detecting and handling threats
- Memory system storing and retrieving contextual information
- Full Discord integration with slash commands functional

## Implementation Scope
- **40+ Python files** across gateway, Discord bot, and embedding service
- **15+ data models** with proper validation
- **5 database migrations** with user-scoped schemas
- **4 API routers** with comprehensive endpoints
- **Background job system** with scheduling
- **Security framework** with injection detection
- **Testing infrastructure** with fixtures and mocks

## Critical Dependencies
**External Services:**
- Chutes.ai API (primary LLM)
- Groq API (fast scoring LLM)
- Gemini API (embeddings)
- Discord API
- Letta framework v0.6.8

**Technology Stack:**
- PostgreSQL 16.4 + pgvector
- Qdrant v1.12.1 (vector database)
- Redis 7.4.7+ (caching)
- FastAPI 0.118.0 (API gateway)
- Discord.py 2.6.3 (bot interface)
- Docker + Compose (containerization)

## Notes
- This is a production-grade system that integrates multiple AI services, sophisticated personality modeling, and real-time conversation management
- The implementation will be systematic, building from infrastructure foundation to advanced AI features
- Refer to `deployment-plan.md` for detailed technical specifications, code examples, and architectural decisions
- All user data is scoped by `user_id` to ensure proper multi-tenant isolation
- System includes comprehensive error handling and degraded mode operations for reliability
